 So this is how their stagofloat is selling off those investment activities. What do you think happened to Sears right after this financial statement of this shoot? They went bankrupt. So in October of 2018, about six months after this was issued, Sears declared bankruptcy. They said they were inflowed on all 142 stores. The reason they went bankrupt is that there was a debt covenant that was due. So they were unable to make a $164 million debt payment. That is what drove Sears into bankruptcy. They were then revived, someone bought Sears. So you actually can still see Sears. They're thriving in a lot of third world countries. They also have been combined with Kmart. Kmart is huge in Australia. Everyone was shopping like Kmart is the cool place to be going. Sears is not doing great pretty much anywhere in the US. One of the reasons I have us look at this financial statement is I want you to go at the very bottom of it. Quickly tell me what is my change in cash year over year? Just an approximation. What's happening? It's increasing by about $50 million. When our statement of cash flows, how do you feel about it's increasing in cash? We feel good. We're like Sears must be killing it. We're $50 million richer. But after looking at this statement of cash flows, we're able to see a lot of problems that you want to have been able to see with just our balance sheet or income statement. That way the statement is so helpful. It dies into those areas that otherwise would be obscured. So let's talk through how the statement is actually created. In our statement, there are three sections. So our first is we're going to focus on states, our operating activities. Operating activities is what is happening on the day to day in our business. When we think of these activities, there's two things that need to come to mind. I'm going to go ahead and write it over here. It's won't be no exciting so much. So operations, you should think this is my income statement plus my working capital. When I say working capital, I'm talking about my short-term assets and my short-term liabilities. So an example of this would be my accounts receivable. My accounts receivable directly correlates with myself. That's why it's part of my operating activities. So both of those are going to be what we think about. Another example would be my wages panel. My wages panel directly going to correspond to my wages bits, something that's happening on the day to day operations. So it's going to be part of my operating activities. The next section we have is our investing activities. Investing activities are those that we enter into for a long term to provide us with future benefits. What does this sound like to you? It sounds like an asset. A long-term asset, exactly. So our investing activities, when you think of these, we think of our property, put out equipment, and we think of anything that has the word investment. Those are our investing activities. If I find Pp&E or I'm selling Pp&E, that's going to be related to how long-term assets is going to go into my investing section. Our last section is my financing section. Financing is how am I funding my business? How do I have this cash? So when we think of financing, we're going to think of our long-term debt. So I'll do long-term debt and our equity. Those are three different classifications on our statement of cash flow. This is going to cover 95% of everything you ever see. There's always going to be exceptions to any rule, but in our classes are 95% rule. It's going to cover most of what you would ever encounter in the real world. In your book, there was this example, and I want to just touch on some of them to show you how it supplies for a 95% rule. In our financing activities, we can see our stock. Financing is going to be our equity section. This is how we got our funding. Investing, we're going to see our purchase of our long-term assets, our cabbags. Of course, we need investing. Operating, we would see our purchase of inventory, our sale of goods and services. Now there's one on here I really want to highlight, and the reason I'm going to highlight it is because it's one that I don't necessarily agree with, so I want to make sure we're all comfortable with it. That one is the payment of interest. Now payment of interest is in our operating section, but we all know that payment of interest relates to long-term debt. Under international accounting standards, they actually do have this in financing. US Gap has made clear stouts that we treat the payment of interest as an operating activity because it is on the income statement. That's one that you're just going to have to remember, so I would highlight that in your notes, that payment of interest is going to be in our operating section, and that's just something that we all have to come terms with, even though I would really like it to be down here. When we receive interest, it's still going to be an operating. It will be interest revenue, which is on the income statement. Yeah, great question. To help us out with this, we're going to go to a real world example now. So CVS pharmacy, I have pulled these lines from their statement of cash flow. What I'm going to have you do is take a few minutes, go through and mark whether these are operating, financing, or investment activities, using your 95-cent break work. Go ahead and get started with people around you. I was unsure of that one, since I was just feeling like, if you've been investing, I still think, yeah, my best guess would be investing, that's what it is. Kind of like buying like an asset, or a long term asset. I'm not getting it there. And then I saw an operating, investing, operating, investing, finance, operating, investing, finance. This one I wasn't sure if those finance are operating. I said, I can't see how it could part of it because it's part of the income statement, but it's also like the shareholder. This one actually is, I know why we just saw that last time. And an operating, operating, investment. It's been a spine-free way. It's been a really nice job. I think I'm pursuing people in the state. I think it's the most I've ever been in. That's it. It's an operating, yes, exactly. It means to have the option. So, I know, I think the event is like, financing, actually, but when you're receiving it, it's like, oh, what are the reasons we operate? Operating. Yeah, to the end of the statement account. Okay. Thank you. So, paying dividends is fine. Yes, receiving them is operating. Okay. Quick, small check on this. You should have five that are operating. See how you know them that. Here are operating classes. I'm going to have to do that. I'm going to have to do that. I'm going to have to do that. I'm going to have to do that. I'm going to have to do that. Here are operating classifications. So, are insurance benefits paid? That is going to be a day to day thing for a party to see. It's our operating. Our cash receipt from customers. Operating. Our cash pay, their suppliers and employees. That will be operating. My income tax paid. As well as my interest paid. All of those are operating. How many investing did you find? Go ahead and hold your fingers. Perfect. Look like most of our there are four investing activities on here. So, our first one is our acquisitions. This is going to be one of acquiring another company. This is an investment activity. Next is going to be the repurchase or the repurchase. The purchase of property plan equipment. Then the proceeds from a sale of investments. And last, the purchase of investment. All four of those are investing. My process elimination means we have three financing activities. Our repurchase of common stock. Our repayment of our long-term debt. And then our dividends paid. Questions? Yeah, just wondering, that's working from the proceeds from sales. And the securities of investments. I don't know how you're supposed to read that. For me, I read proceeds from sales. And the securities of investments. That's like clashing. Okay, I get what you're saying. This is, I would get rid of this and the securities. And we're going to proceed from sales of investments. Because what it's saying is the selling. Those that are, and we have those that matured, that would be like our debt confidence. That they'd have breached maturity. We're getting the money. That's where you'd read that one. Can you explain why dividends are like different. They're paying pay or receipt. Yeah, exactly. So dividends that we receive give us dividend income. Which goes under income statement. So it goes into an operating activity. Dividends that we pay. What account do they go to? They go to a dividends account. Which is going to be an equity account. Therefore it's going to be in our financing section. That's the reason that those two are going to be different. There are good questions. Other questions on this. Um, how that acquisition means investing. So with acquisition, we acquire another company. and if it's that we expect that company to help us in the future. So we're investing into that to give you benefits. When it says net of cash acquired, what that's saying is if we pay cash for cash, that nets out. So that's what that sends the saying. You don't need to worry about that part. All right, any other questions on here? At the end of class today, I'll show you a fun little song. It'll be helpful as we're going through our statement of cash flows. But the rest of class, they were going to talk through the operating section. This is the most complicated section. And the reason for that is there's actually two different methods that you can do the operating section. You can do the direct method, or we can do the indirect method. And you read in your book that 99% of companies do the indirect method. But in class today, we are going to learn both methods. And now you're all mumbling in your minds. You're not going to say that loud, because you're too nice. And you're saying, but Professor Eldridge, if 99% of companies use this method, why do I have to know both of them? And that is a totally valid question. The reason that we need to know both of the methods is that the direct method makes the most sense from our sampling counting points. So logically, it's going to make sense to what we're doing. If I start with the indirect method, it becomes these magical steps that somehow get you to the right answer. We can't understand why we got there. Starting with the direct method shows you why we can't get there with the indirect method. So the benefits of understanding it will vastly outweigh the time we take learning it. I will promise that, you know. Yeah. But this is that indirect is a more affordable company than which, like, to whatever company is, it's a more expensive company. So even if they do the direct method, they have to report the indirect method. So it's one percent of companies even do it. So they're just flexing and doing more work? Yeah, yeah. They just really want to show off their counting facilities. So you want to work with those companies. Is there a two you're looking for? No. Hey, some things to highlight here. Under either method, we're going to get to the same answer. So I will show that to you today. If there's one method that makes more sense to you than the other one, I would rely on that. And make sure that you can get to the other one. But you can pick your favorite. I like the direct method more. That is my favorite. So we have to start with that one. This second thing you need to know, this only applies to the operating sections. So when we go to financing and investing, there's no direct method versus indirect method. They just have the one method, and it actually is the direct method in those two sections. For either method, we are going to think through it from the standpoint of our T accounts. Now, remember, in our operating section, we are looking at my working capital, which is my short-term asset and my short-term liabilities. So we're going to start with those T accounts up here. In particular, we're going to start by talking about the account receivable. What you need to know with these T accounts is how they change balances. So how do they increase versus how they decrease? With account receivable, how do we increase our account receivable? People paying all their accounts. Credit sales, yep. Exactly. How do we decrease our account receivable? Cash collections. Exactly. So we have a beginning balance that increases with ourselves. And it decreases with my collections. I would not feel this way to your little flow chart I've given you. Just FYI, see somebody do me that. You're going to want that flow chart for the next time. So one of these numbers shows up on my income statement. Which numbers on my income statement? Sales. This number is going to be the same. The wish number corresponds to cash. Elections. So there's a few different ways to think about this T account to help us determine the cash we collected from our customers. One way is to acknowledge that the difference between my ending and my beginning balance is also the difference through my cells and my collections. There's a few different mathematical ways to think through this. The easiest way for me, and I think my beginning plus my cells minus my collections gives me my ending. That's the easiest mathematical way for me to think through it. But there's other ways because it's an equation you can reward that. So you could take yourselves minus your collections, equals your ending minus your beginning. Or you can just say, your cells minus my change at accounts receivable equals my collections. Multiple ways to do that. We're going to work through it with numbers because I think that will help you see exactly what we're doing here. So I've given you the financial information you need. What I want you to do. I want you to complete the T accounts for accounts receivable in my income tax payable. So I give you the numbers. Go ahead and do the calculations to determine what cash it would be collecting customers and what cash should be pay for in accounts payable. Then we're going to regroup or talk through how do we determine the cash and paper in the form? So take two minutes to do that, and then we'll come back together. Thank you. Our sales are all sales. Let's talk about that when I have the number up there. Because it actually doesn't matter. I'm so tired. Oh, nice. Hey, let's work through these giving up. So accounts receivable gave you the beginning and the ending. I gave you sales of 300. So you were solving for cash collections, which is going to be 280. The short hand way of doing this is I take myself minus my increase in accounts receivable, and that gives me my cash plus it. I had a great question. Are we assuming that all these sales are on credit? The answer is it doesn't actually matter. And it's not cheating the system to the soon so. The way I'm going to demonstrate this is we're going to have our same T account. If I told you that 100 of these were on cash, you would know that we had cash collected of 100. That would change my sales to be 200. What would be my cash collected on credit sales? 180. So I would add that to the 100 I already have. It gives me cash collected in total of 280. So the sales whether or not their credit is going to be the same now. We would just pull it out if you wanted to only put credit sales in there. So it's not cheating to put the full sales number in there. We treat the cash sales as if they're instant credit sales. So we could put them in there. It's a good question there. Hey, any other questions on our cash pocket or passwords? The next one I asked you to do is my cash pay for taxes. So which of these numbers did I give you? The pay to the expense. The expense. So I gave you an expense of 30. So we solved for the paid. And you thought that we paid 15,000. So another way to see this is my income tax expense was 30. I increased my income tax payable by 15. That gives me 15,000. Those were our first two accounts. The next one that we're going to look at, we're going to do together. And this is my cash paid for inventory. Inventory goes down when we sell it. So with our cost of goods sold is how we decrease our inventory. Inventory increases when we purchase something. But are either of those cash transactions they are not? Because we don't know whether we purchase for cash or on account. So these two T accounts are tied together when we're doing our statement of cash flows. These are the only two that are tied together. So we need to remember these. Our purchases from inventory then becomes my purchases and my accounts payable. Remember when we talked about liabilities, accounts payable was only a payable to our suppliers. So that's why this rings true. And so our purchases are going to be what's increased our accounts payable. Then our decrease is when we pay. So I made that nice and green for you. That's when cash actually goes out. And so when we make that payment to our suppliers, I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I want you to go ahead and put the numbers in to solve our cash payable suppliers. So I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. Once you've gotten your calf pain to supply, go ahead and fill out your forebox and add up what you're cashed from operating at with these. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. I'm going to give you about 60 seconds. Okay, let's work through this one together. Okay, let's work through this one together. Okay, let's work through this one together. Which of these numbers did I give you? Which of these numbers did I give you? Dogs. Dogs. One eighty. Dogs. One eighty. So then we're going to solve our purchases of 220. One seventy. One seventy. Once I know I purchased one in before I know that's the same amount of candy all over there. One seventy. One eighty. Lastly, we were going to solve for what was paid. So 245 was paid. You could shortcut that by taking calls, minus my change in inventory, minus my change in accounts payable, both those will get you the same answer. If we put that all together, we got cash collected from our customers at 2A. Cash paid for inventory of 245, and cash paid for taxes of 15. So our cash from operations or a CFO is going to be $20,000. This is the flavor of what we're doing when we're doing the direct method. Yeah. Why do you use 245 instead of 220? Because that would be a good extension. Because 245 is how much cash we actually paid. They got it, let me know if you want. You're the end. Yeah. How much do you get to the 220? Yeah, what's the amount? It's going to be from the 180. I've cost a good soul. So if I take 110 plus 180, minus 150, they give me 220. How do you know it's 110 plus 2? That doesn't make sense. Because I know my beginning. I know what subtracts out of them. So why would you add it? Oh, pardon me. That should be a subtract. I said it wrong. So once I know what subtracts out of it, I know the ending is subtracted. That's what's left. So I need to know what is split into it. So it's been so 180 plus 1, 15, so plus 10, things are minus 1, 15. No. Let's see, just math together. 180 plus 1, 15, minus 1, 10, here to there. So it's going to be our beginning. I think our 1, we've got 1, 10 of the beginning. Then we would add in whatever perturbing is. But I don't know what number that is. From there, it gives me what's available for cell. That can go one of two places. Either a soldier or a still have it. So that is going to equal 180 plus 1, 15. So another way of doing is that you take 1, 10, minus 1, 80, minus 1, 15. And that would give you the negative of your purchases. This is having three solvents for it. OK. Direct method. Direct method, you start with your valid sheets. So we're starting with our working capital accounts. We're going to analyze how do these accounts go up and down? And where does cash come into play? That's what we're doing with direct method. One of the big advantages of direct method is it tells me exactly where my cash went. It tells me what cash did I collect from my customers? What did I pay for taxes versus what did I pay for inventory? We won't see the same thing in the indirect method. So this is the clear method for your investors to know exactly where your cash is going. Indirect method, instead of going line by line and looking at our working capital, we start in the income statement. So we say, here's my net income. And I know in that income that it has my sales. It has my cost of goods sold. It has my wages expense. All of those things are already in that income. So we're going to adjust that income in three ways. The first way is that we are going to add that any non-cash expense. There's three in this class you need to know about. This is depreciation, amoritization, and impairments. What we're doing here is we're saying, you decreased my net income for these items. But actually, they're paying a cash. So it shouldn't have decreased net income when you took depreciation expense. The next thing you're going to do is you're going to subtract out any gains and losses that relate to non-operating items. So the big one is going to be any gains and losses that relate to PPNE and investments. The reason we're doing this is we are going to account for those in the investment section of our statement of cash flow. So if I left them in here, I'd be double counting it. They would hit my operating side, and they would also hit my investing side. So we need to subtract out any gains or add value to those losses that we're counting for. The last thing you're going to do are third adjustment is we're going to adjust for our changes in our working capital accounts. This is what we just did with the direct method. Where I say is my beginning balance greater than my ending balance. There's one primary rule that we need to make sure we understand, which is is my assets are increasing. It means my cash is decreasing. An easy way to think about this is to think back to our counter-receivable tea account. My counter-receivable increased, that means what's showing on my income statement as my sales is greater than what I actually got for cash. That's the logic of what we're doing. We're taking the accrual method that you use for your income statement, and we're adjusting to what's the reality of the cash that we have. The flip side of that is going to be my liabilities. And if my liabilities are increasing, my cash is greater. Both of these relate back to what we did with the direct method. That's why we do that method first. After you've done these adjustments, we've been sum up all the adjustments, and that gets us to our operating cash flows. So what I want you to do is a quick intuition check with people around you. You've got two minutes. I have given you different changes and accounts. I want you to tell me whether this change will increase or decrease my net income to get me to my cash from operating activities. Go ahead and take two minutes, and we'll come back together. Now you've got to get that right. See, there are numbers going to turn to the last one. I don't believe there's so much for the whole time though. Yeah, I'm in the lot of places. It's not right, it's a wish in 90s. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What you get for this one? Um, I said the way decreasing could be right was a short term asset. I could not. There was going down so cash will. But I'm making the information. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. Oh, I'm sure about it. Oh, that was right. Thanks, that's the main. Did you get the real time? Yes, the track. The tracks you try out out out. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was saying that it would have started in a cell. Or it's a box. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's $20. So, it's true. So, it's true. Yeah. Yeah. That's me. That's me. No. It's not falsely. Yeah. I know, it is. I'm laughing. Yeah. I'm warning. Yeah. I think that it's a lie, I think. It's a lie, I think. You're knowing how to happen. It's so nice. It's so nice. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's a lie. Let's get a lesson together. Let's get a lesson together. Let's get a lesson together. Let's get a lesson together. Okay, what we're going to do is, I knew we're going to tell anybody we are adding it. We are subtracting it. Okay, so first one, our increase in account is usable. It's an asset account that's increasing. So it's going to be subtracted Increase in Accounts Payable. Add, it's a liability account. Increase in a liability is going to be an increase for net income. Increase in Imminories. Decrease in Accruid Expenses. Track. Track. So, type of account is Accruid Expenses. In the liability. Alright, an increase in Unerred Revenue. Add, type of account is Unerred Revenue. A liability. A decrease in Pre-Pagrin. Add, because pre-pagrin is an asset. Increase in PPME. That is just proof one. This is a nots and operating activity. You should not do anything with an increase in PPME. With that in mind, a decrease in bonds payable. None. This is also not a working account of account. So, one of the biggest mistakes I see students do, and they get to the exam, is they're feeling so confident, that they just want to do this on every account I give them. This is only for a working account of low accounts. So, if I give you my equity account or my long-term debt or my PPME, it's not going to have to have an operating section. Will it impact your financing section? Maybe. We'll cover that next class. Yeah. So, if you have a decrease in a contract, if you have a decrease in a contract, you can add. If we have a decrease in a contract, you can add. I just like memorize it. So, there are multiple options of how to do this. For me, this is the easiest way I memorize these boxes. For other people who want to think through the intuition, there are some helpful songs in the practice video that will walk you through other ways you can think about it. But as long as you understand, then if an asset is increasing, cash is going down, you can subtract it. That will get you to a write-out there. So, with this PPME and Boschable, not being discerned, that's because they're long-term. Yes. And you can see the indirect or just all sorts of work and stuff. So, with either of you, the director or indirect, we only are doing work in capital. Only do you work in capital. Yep. So, that's the only reason these are assets. And this is going to be a liability. You remember? Yes. So, it's working capital by just transferring current assets. Current life, that is. Yep, that's it. That is working capital. Exactly. Earlier you had mentioned depreciation. And stuff with that. Who's the great question? So, we don't have to worry about increase or decrease in depreciation because it's a temporary account. So, it doesn't change you every year. We don't have to worry about depreciation. We would add back. So, yeah, great question there. All right. If you have more questions around how to think through this, there's helpful practice videos that talk through other ways, think through it. I always just remember that if a liability is increasing, cash increases, and then everything else can flow from there. So, it's whichever is easiest for you to remember, that's all going to flow from what we did in the direct method. It's our difference between what we're doing in the same intercap. Let's look at a real world example of this. This is not in your packet. This is low, and it's there, statement of cash lows. You can see we start with their net income, their net earnings, from their income statement. Then they add back their non-cash expenses and depreciation, organization. They subtract gains and add their losses. So, we can see their gain loss on the cell. It's attracted out. Then they adjust for their changes in working capital. Knowing what we know, accounts payables and liability accounts. If this is negative, does that mean their accounts payable with up or down? And means it went down. With our asset account inventory is positive. Does that mean the inventory went up or down? Down. Means their inventory decrease. This is a helpful thing I would recommend doing to make sure you can understand from the financial statements, what is that telling me about my balances and my T accounts? To help us with this, we are now going to use our same information and do the indirect method statement of cash lows. I have total confidence that you guys know how to calculate net income on your own. But to make it easier for you to have already calculated that, so it's going to be 80K is your net income. We know in the indirect method that that is our starting point. It's our 80K. What you now need to do is do the three adjustments we talked about. So add back or non-cash items, add or subtract maybe in loss, and then adjust for my changes in my working capital account. You're going to have about five minutes to do this. You already know my cash from operations. What should your number tie out to at the end of this? 20,000. Because we know that the direct method and the indirect method are going to get us the same thing. So you have your check figure, go ahead and work through this with the people around you. Well, I don't know how I did it, but it's the same thing. Do you ever do a question? And you feel like I was guided through that question. But there's no reason why I should have gotten that right? No. You know what I mean? Where it's like doing the question, like there's like I'm getting this wrong right now. And that would be any get it right? No. I just had that experience. Oh really? When? Right now. Oh wow. Let's go. What am I getting? No, I'm getting this right now. Okay. How are you getting it? How do you get 20 yet? I don't know. But there's an ad back on cash. There you go. Why? How did you go? You had it back in the day. I could be asking that 100 more days. Yeah, I could check it. I could check it. Oh, it's your game. Oh, I was surprised with 10. I was up by a salad. Yeah, I loved that. Those fine bags in a bandit apartment. We assume... Or as they're tall in here. You get 20. What do you mean by that? I don't know. So like for the total like, I'm just gonna have to do that. So I did 80 and added the 21k because that was a non-cash expense. So then I got to 101. Then I subtracted 11k because it was my game. So I subtracted our games, add back losses. Oh, subtracted? Yeah. And then from there, 20, 20, 40. Yeah, that's what I had to do. So that worked. Good for low. I don't know. I'm gonna put this in the chairs. So, yeah. Oh, I got a big one there. What do you want to say about that? Hmm. I got a big one. Last. I got a big one. I got a big one. I got a big one. Yeah. Why? Why? I'm sorry. Yo, I can do it. You can go to play on the news. Okay, in there. I can't do that. What? I think what do you got to do? Watch it, add. Please, don't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's work through this big chair room. Let's work through this big congratulate to you all. So, first thing we know is how you start going to bank Typically you are going to have to calculate that so make you comfortable with how you can calculate income. Now, you re gonna add anchor non cache items. There's three in this bar. So, what are non cache items? Appreciation, Am темперion and impairment. Perfect. Any of those three. If I give you those, ad those bats. So in our example, we had depreciation of 21,000, we're gonna add that back. Then we reverse out the non-operating items. We have one, our gain loss, our gain on the salopee guinea. The reason that we're reversing this out is because it was included in that income, but we know it doesn't relate to working capital. It's part of our investing. So we'll touch on it in investing, don't you worry? We're still gonna touch on that patch, but it shouldn't be in this section. That's why we're reversing it out. Then we're gonna adjust our changes in those working capital accounts. So our assets, if they've decreased, they're gonna increase, if they've increased, they're gonna decrease. So our increase in AR and inventory is going to decrease my net income by 20 of 40. My decrease in account payable, which is liability, is gonna decrease my net income by 25. And my increase in taxes payable, another liability, is going to increase my net income by 15. So we get our cash from operations of 20,000. Plash just on this. Any of these that you put in the wrong spot are dead and correctly. Yeah. I just got to talk what I do. Just kind of sort of all looking for. Is it matter that I contest, we know like the non-cash stuff is up there, and it's kind of just the same day. It does not know that you know like which one of these is non-cash versus which is like as a change in working capital. But I would never be like, which is section number two. I just know how to get the numbers. We good. Okay, big thing I wanna hit on here. Both of these methods get us to not say an answer. Both of them got us to the 20K. They did it in two different ways. So if the direct method, I can tell you exactly how much cash I collected from my customers. With the indirect method, do I ever tell you the exact non-cash that I collected from my customers? No. I don't. So it's harder for investors to really understand what's happening when we're using the indirect method. That's why I prefer the direct method. Now, thank you, Cheryl. You've got a test coming up. There are ways that I can force you one method or the other. If I ask you for my cash when I pay suppliers, you have to do the direct method. So although most companies just use the indirect method, make sure you also know how to do the direct method. However, if I just ask you for my cash operations, you could use either method and you may wanna use both methods to make sure that you get the same thing. Both ways, if you're not forgetting something, that you otherwise would have known if you had done the other method. So, to help you remember are different financial statements and where this classification goes and a little song for you. If I need to borrow some money when all these refinements my business and grow the cash that I get is fine and see the last section on the cash flow but interest payout and interest receipt these cash flows are always in operating. Not different as I pay, but those I receive are classified operating. My company. I have four more verses. So, you really wanna know you could Google this. But the main reason I show you this is I want all of us to remember that interest paid out and interest received are always in operating. So, if you're in the testing center, I want that line to run through your mind because the two of them are kind of falling over the ocean because it's obvious. I want that to run through your mind because that's super important and we'll lose a lot of students there. All right, a few other things before I let you go for the day. No, there we go. We have two post class quizzes, do one Thursday and we have a project, do one Thursday. I have about half my classes who complete the project. I would highly recommend getting this done as soon as possible. It's gonna be the easiest of the things you need to do in this class. Just go down the way and you can first study for a super fun exam coming up. The other thing I want to mention, this Thursday after the exams, we have our professional day. This will be where certain people from industry are gonna come in. They're gonna talk about what careers make counting look like. This is an optional day. I love my client out of students, but if you do not want to attend, I will not be offended. There will be a spell rat and I would recommend I'm not. So what? I would recommend coming with questions about half of the day will just be Q and A. So there are things that you want to know about accounting, the good, the bad, the ugly. Come ready with those questions for our professionals. That is it. I will see you all on Thursday. Thank you. Thank you.
